CF 201 Week 3 Bus Mall Project
Create an app to get user votes on images, seen 3 at a time and non-repeating, to help decide which products should be in a Bus Mall catalog. After the user has voted, render a results table and a chart. Also use local storage to retain the results if the user wants to vote again. As a standalone project, also create a page with a shopping cart and takes in customer information.
